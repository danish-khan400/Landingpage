    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <h2>Welcome to Only Fresh – Where Every Slice Tells a Story</h2>
    <p>
      Born in a tiny Mumbai kitchen and baked with big dreams, <strong>Only Fresh</strong> is a startup founded by an engineering student with a passion for desserts and a love for freshness.
      What started as a small hobby to beat the academic grind has now risen into a full-fledged cake venture committed to making life a little sweeter.
    </p>

    <h2>Why "Only Fresh"?</h2>
    <p>
      Because we believe in one simple rule: <em>If it’s not fresh, it’s not worth it.</em><br />
      At Only Fresh, every cake is made to order – no preservatives, no shortcuts, and definitely no compromises.
      From sourcing premium ingredients to handcrafting each design, we make sure your cake doesn’t just look good, but feels like it was baked just for you (because it was).
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      To bring <strong>freshly baked joy</strong> to every doorstep in Mumbai – whether you're celebrating a birthday,
      marking a milestone, or simply craving a sweet escape.
    </p>

    <h2>Made in Mumbai, Loved Everywhere</h2>
    <p>
      We’re proud to be a local brand started in Mumbai – a city that never stops dreaming, and neither do we.
      As students, creators, and cake lovers, we're always experimenting, innovating, and improving to deliver cakes that surprise and delight.
    </p>

    <h2>Let's Bake Something Beautiful Together</h2>
    <p>
      We’re just getting started. Join us on our journey and treat yourself to cakes that are always soft,
      always fresh, and always made with love.
